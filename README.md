The target user is an individual or business looking for an efficient way to sell their products.

Images: ??demo screen shots ?

Challenges:  Setting up the login/logout Passport functionality. Merging code amongst group members to github. Adding vendor images to the database. Changing from html to handlebars. 

Future development: Perhaps find a way to add in more functionality to the dashboard so the vendors specific changes look more real world.
